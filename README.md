# Financial-Anomaly-Detection-and-Risk-Analysis
•	Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict fraudulent transactions and designed a real-time alert system to prevent fraudulent activities.

•	Performed exploratory data analysis on 138K+ transactions and preprocessed data by removing duplicates, encoding categorical features and handling imbalanced labeled data by SMOTE.

•	Built, trained and deployed supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with AWS SageMaker,

•	Optimized hyper-parameters with k-fold cross-validation and applied regularization to overcome overfitting.

•	Evaluated model performance of classification and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors.
